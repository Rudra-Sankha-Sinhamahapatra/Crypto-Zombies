# Chapter 7: Public Functions & Security

Now let's modify `feedAndMultiply` to take our cooldown timer into account.

Looking back at this function, you can see we made it `public` in the previous lesson. An important security practice is to examine all your public and external functions, and try to think of ways users might abuse them. Remember — unless these functions have a modifier like `onlyOwner`, any user can call them and pass them any data they want to.

Re-examining this particular function, the user could call the function directly and pass in any `_targetDna` or `_species` they want to. This doesn't seem very game-like — we want them to follow our rules!

On closer inspection, this function only needs to be called by `feedOnKitty()`, so the easiest way to prevent these exploits is to make it `internal`.

## Put it to the Test

1. Currently `feedAndMultiply` is a `public` function. Let's make it `internal` so that the contract is more secure. We don't want users to be able to call this function with any DNA they want.

2. Let's make `feedAndMultiply` take our `cooldownTime` into account. First, after we look up `myZombie`, let's add a `require` statement that checks `_isReady()` and passes `myZombie` to it. This way the user can only execute this function if a zombie's cooldown time is over.

3. At the end of the function let's call `_triggerCooldown(myZombie)` so that feeding triggers the zombie's cooldown time.

Here's how the updated function should look:

```solidity
function feedAndMultiply(uint _zombieId, uint _targetDna, string memory _species) internal {
    Zombie storage myZombie = zombies[_zombieId];
    require(_isReady(myZombie));
    _targetDna = _targetDna % dnaModulus;
    uint newDna = (myZombie.dna + _targetDna) / 2;
    if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_species)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("kitty"))) {
        newDna = newDna - newDna % 100 + 99;
    }
    _createZombie("NoName", newDna);
    _triggerCooldown(myZombie);
}
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the function is more secure and that users cannot bypass the intended game mechanics.


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
